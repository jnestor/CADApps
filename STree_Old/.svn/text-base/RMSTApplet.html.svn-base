      </b></font>
      <p>This applet illustrates the construction of a Rectilinear
Minimum
Spanning Tree (RSMT) using Prim's Algorithm. A RMST connects
all terminals together in a way that minimizes the overall distance of
the
connections in this tree. Prim's Algorithm operates incrementally on
a partial tree starting with a single terminal - on each iteration, it
adds an edge between the partial tree and the terminal that is closest
to any terminal in the partial tree. <br>

      <font face="arial,helvetica" size="+1"><b>To Use the Applet</b></font>
      <br>
      <br>
This applet creates a small number of terminals at random locations.
Use the "VCR" controls to start, pause, single-step or stop the
animation. <br>
      </p>
      <p>There are several ways to edit the terminals shown in the
animation: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add a terminal by clicking at a location where no terminal
exists. </li>
        <li>Move a terminal by clicking and dragging to
the desired location. </li>
        <li>Delete a terminal by pressing the CONTROL key and clicking
over an
existing terminal. </li>
      </ul>
Note that editing terminals will stop a running
animation since the previously executed steps may no longer be valid. <br>
      <br>
Clicking the "AUTO" button places the applet in automatic mode, where
the complete RMST is recalculated whenever the terminals are edited or
moved.

      <p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="+1"><b>About Rectilinear
Mininimum Spanning Trees</b></font><br><br>
Given a set of terminal points in a plane, a rectilinear
minimum spanning tree is a set of edges which connects all the
terminals with minimum rectilinear distance.&nbsp; Rectilinear distance
(also called "Manhattan Distance") is the sum of the horizontal and
vertical distance between two points.&nbsp; It is used instead of
Euclidean distance in VLSI CAD
applications because VLSI processes support only horizontal and
vertical wires.
      <br>
      <br>
The RMST can be used as an estimate of the length of
a net that connects together multiple terminals.
      <br>
      <br>
The RMST Problem is a special case of the Minimum Spanning Tree
problem studied in Computer Science Algorithms textbooks in that the
distances between the points imply a complete graph.
