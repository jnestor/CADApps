This applet illustrates how a Steiner Rectilinear Tree (SRT)
can be constructed by adding <span style="font-style: italic;">Steiner
Points</span> to an existing set of terminals.&nbsp; The user can edit the
number and location of a set of terminals and then add and/or delete
Steiner points to evaluate their effect on the length of the resulting
tree.  The applet then displays the Rectilinear Minimum Spanning that
includes both the termianls and Steiner points to form a Steiner
Rectilinear Tree.
<br><br>
A Minimal Steiner Rectilinear Tree (MSRT) is a minimum-length Steiner
      Tree.&nbsp; This applet does <i>not</i> compute the minimal Steiner
      Tree but instead lets the user
      experiment with different choices of Steiner points to discover
      their impact on overall length.

      <br>
      <br>
Terminals are displayed as small squares; Steiner points are displayed
as circles.  Edges show the edges of a Rectilinear Minimum Spanning
Tree that connects terminals and Steiner Points.
<br><br>
The applet operates in two modes: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Terminal Edit</span> mode, and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Steiner Point Edit</span> mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The use can switch between the two modes by clicking the "STMODE"
button.&nbsp;

<br>
      </p>
      <p>Terminal Edit mode is used to add, delete, or move terminal nodes
as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add a terminal by clicking at a location where no terminal
exists. </li>
        <li>Move a terminal by clicking and dragging to
the desired location. </li>
        <li>Delete a terminal by pressing the CONTROL key and clicking.</li>
      </ul>
While in Terminal Edit mode the applet computes and displays the
rectilinear Minimum Spanning Tree (RSMT) of the terminal points after
each change.<br>
      <br>
In Steiner Point Edit mode,
Steiner points may be added and removed at locations on the "Hanan
Grid", which is shown in gray (see explanation below) as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>Add a Steiner point by clicking at a location on the Hanan
Grid.</li>
        <li>Remove a Steiner point by pressing the CONTROL key and clicking.</li>
      </ul>
While in Steiner Pont Edit mode, the Steiner tree that results from the
selected points is computed using the RMST algorithm and displayed
along with the improvement in cost over the RMST without added Steiner
ponts.

      <p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="+1"><b>About Steiner Trees</b></font><br>
      </p>
      <p>Given a set of terminal points in a plane, a Minimum Steiner
Rectilinear Tree (SRT) is a set of edges which connects all the
terminals along with a set of added "Steiner points" such that the
rectilinear distance is minimized.&nbsp; F. Hwang [Hwang, 1976]
proved that the length of a Steiner tree can be up to 3/2 times shorter
than a Rectilinear Minimum Spanning Tree on the same set of terminals. <br>
      </p>
      <p>M. Hanan [Hanan, 1966] proved that a Minimum RST can be
constructed using points on a grid defined by the x and y coordinates
of the terminal points (now known as the Hanan Grid).<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Minimum Steiner Rectilinear tree problem is be NP-Hard [Garey, 1977], which inidicates that any exact
algorithm will have a worst-case execution time that grows
exponentially with the problem size.&nbsp; In spite of this, exact
algorithms such as&nbsp; have been found that complete in reasonable
time for large examples [Warme 2003].<br>
      </p>
      <p>Several heuristics have also been developed; we plan to add a
brief survey along with animations of some key heuristics in the future.<br>
