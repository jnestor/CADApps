      <br>
      <br>
The routing surface is represented as a grid in which each gridpoint
can
be the source of a connection, a destination of a connection, or a wire
that
connects adjacent gridpoints. To route connections, follow the prompt
and
click on the source and destination points. The applet will then show
the search performed by the algorithm and the final connection that
is made. You can make additional connections by clicking to select
additional source and destination points. <br>
      <br>
To erase all connections and start over, click on the "CLEAR" button. <br>

      <font face="arial,helvetica" size="+1"><b>About Hadlock's
Algorithm</b></font> <br>
      <br>
Hadlock's Algorithm is a variation on the Lee Algorithm that reduces
execution time during the expansion phase by biasing the search in the
direction of the target.&nbsp; Unlike the <a href="../MazeRouter.html">Lee
Algorithm</a>, which uses the distance from the source as its cost
function, Hadlock's algorithm uses a value known as the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">detour number</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
detour number&nbsp; D(P) of a path P from the source to a gridpoint
reflects the number of grids that this path has "detoured" away from
the target. Since the expansion algorithm selects nodes with the lowest
cost for expansion, this biases the search in the direction of the
target.&nbsp; When an obstacle is reached, a detour is necessary and
nodes labeled with higher values are expanded.&nbsp; The backtrace
phase operates identically to the Lee Algorithm.<br>
      <br>
Because it still does exhaustive search as a fallback, Hadlock's
algorithm still guarantees that a minimum-cost connection will be found
if it exists.<br>
