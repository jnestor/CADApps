<P>
This applet demonstrates a well-known CAD algorithm for routing connections
between modules.

<BR><BR>
The routing surface is represented as a grid in which each gridpoint can
be the source of a connection, a destination of a connection, or a wire that
connects adjacent gridpoints.  To route connections, follow the prompt and
click on the source and destination points.  The applet will then show
the search performed by the Lee Algorithm and the final connection that
is made.  You can make additional connections by clicking to select
additional source and destination points.

To erase all connections and start over, click on the 
&quot;CLEAR&quot; button.

<BR><BR>
<I>Routing </I>is the task of finding a set of connections that
will wire together the terminals of different modules on a printed
circuit board or VLSI chip. In the simplest case, these connections
are made on a single routing layer of metal.  Each connection or <I>net</I>
connects a source terminal to a destination terminal.
<BR><BR>
The Maze Routing algorithm represents the routing layer as a grid, where
each gridpoint can contain connections to adjacent gridpoints.
It searches for a shortest-path connection between the source
and destination nodes of a connection by performing a breadth-first
search and labelling each gridpoint with it's distance from the
source.  This <I>expansion</I> phase will eventually reach the destination
node if a connection is possible.  A second <I>traceback</I> phase then
forms the connection by following any path with decreasing labels.
This algorithm is guaranteed to find the shortest path between a source
and destination for a given connection.  However, when multiple connections
are made one connection may block other connections.

<BR><BR>

Some routing problems cannot be completed using only one routing
layer.  In this case, multiple layers are used; connections between
layers are known as <I>vias</I>.  The maze routing algorithm can
be adapted to support multiple layers by treating the layout as
a set of stacked grids where vertical connections can be made
between corresponding points on each grid.
<BR><BR>
The Maze Routing Applet supports multiple layers.  Here is an example of 
routing with three layers:
