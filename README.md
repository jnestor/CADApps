# CADApps
VLSI CAD Algorithm Visualizations implemented as Java Applications.
These visualizations were originally implemented as Java Applets as
part of the CADAPPLETS project (https://cadapplets.lafayette.edu).

Now that applets are no more, we are converting these visualizations to
Java applications that can be downloaded and run by interested parties.
For more information, contact John Nestor at Lafayette College.
