# Wish list of potential changes/improvements to VMV
- FIFO page replacement algorithm should change the legend for the "Clock Table" to the "FIFO Table"
- Remove "reference" bit from page table when using FIFO page replacement
- Generalize "skipTil" to be a breakpoint system, with breakpoint shown in memory reference pane
- Pseudo-LRU, True LRU, and non-LRU replacement algorithms for TLB
- Additional page replacement algorithms: LRU, optimal
- Load a default configuration file
- Load a confuration file using a keyboard shortcut i.e. CTRL-O or CMD-O
- Allow comments in the configuration file
- Clean up internal representation of memory reference "instructions"
