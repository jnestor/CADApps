This applet illustrates the problem formulation for 
<i>VLSI Floorplanning</i>, in which interconnected <i>modules</i> of
different sizes and shapes are assigned to positions on a layout
surface to form a <i>placement</i>.  
Connections are specified as <i>nets</i> between 
<i>terminals</i> on different modules.

The quality of a placment is usually estimated using a weighted sum of
cost estimates.  <i>Area</i> is estimated as area of the bounding box
containing all modules.  <i>Wirelength</i> can be estimated in a number
of ways, but a common approach (used here) is to compute half the
perimeter of the bounding box that contains the terminals of a net.
<I>Module overlap</i> is often included in a cost function as a
<i>penalty function</i> (these are often used in iterative algorithms
like simulated annealing).
Finally, <i>congestion</i> estimates the wireability of interconnect
regions between placed modules.

The applet displays modules as yellow rectanges; terminals are marked
by small black rectangles.  Connections between modules are displayed
using red lines.  This display of nets is sometimes known as a 
"rat's nest" diagram.  Cost estimates are shown above the placement
display.  Note that congestion estimates are not included (yet).

The applet allows the user to manipulate a floorplan placement using
the mouse - just click on a module and drag it.  Modules can also be 
transformed in the following ways:
<OL>
<LI>Rotate - click mouse over module.
<LI>Flip Horizontal - shift-click mouse over module
<LI>Flip Vertical - alt-click mouse over module
</OL>
<B>NOTE:</b>This applet requires the
